Write a program which calculates the area and perimeter of a given rectangle.

Input
The length a and breadth b of the rectangle are given in a line separated by a single space.

Output
Print the area and perimeter of the rectangle in a line. The two integers should be separated by a single space.

Constraints
    1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100



//SOLUTION
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int a, b;
    cin>>a;
    cin>>b;
    cout<<(a*b)<<" "<<2*(a+b)<<endl;
    return 0;
}
