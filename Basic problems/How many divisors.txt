Write a program which reads three integers a, b and c, and prints the number of divisors of c between a and b.

Input
Three integers a, b and c are given in a line separated by a single space.

Output
Print the number of divisors in a line.

Constraints
    1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10000
    a ≤ b



//SOLUTION
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int n=0, a, b, c;
    cin>>a>>b>>c;
    while(a<=b){
        if(c%a == 0)
            n=n+1;
        a++;
    }
    cout<<n<<endl;
}
