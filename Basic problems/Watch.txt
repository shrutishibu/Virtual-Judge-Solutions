Write a program which reads an integer SS [second] and converts it to h:m:sh:m:s where hh, mm, ss denote hours, minutes (less than 60) and seconds (less than 60) respectively.

Input
An integer SS is given in a line.

Output
Print hh, mm and ss separated by ':'. You do not need to put '0' for a value, which consists of a digit.

Constraints
    0≤S≤864000≤S≤86400



//SOLUTION
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){
    int t, h, m;
    cin>>t;
    h = t/3600;
    t = t - (h*3600);
    m = t/60;
    t = t - (m*60);
    cout<<h<<":"<<m<<":"<<t<<endl;
}
