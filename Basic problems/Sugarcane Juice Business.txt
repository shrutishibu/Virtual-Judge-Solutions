    He spends 30%30% of his total income on shop rent.
Alice wonders, what is the juicer's profit (in coins) when he sells NN glasses of sugarcane juice?

Input Format
The first line of input will contain an integer TT — the number of test cases. The description of TT test cases follows. The first and only line of each test case contains an integer NN, as described in the problem statement.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the juicer's profit when he sells NN glasses of juice.
