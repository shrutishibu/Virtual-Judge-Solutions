Given an array of integers, find the sum of the elements of the given array.
Note: Try to solve this without declaring/storing the array elements.

Input Format
First line of input contains T - number of test cases. Its followed by 2T lines, the first line contains N - the size of the array and second line contains the elements of the array.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= ar[i] <= 1015

Output Format
For each test case, print the sum of the elements of the array, separated by new line. 



//SOLUTION
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--){
        long int n, s=0, x;
        cin>>n;
        while(n--){
            cin>>x;
            s+=x;
        }
        cout<<s<<endl;
    }
    return 0;
