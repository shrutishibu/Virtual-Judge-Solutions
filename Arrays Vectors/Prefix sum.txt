You are given an array of NN integer.
You have to answer QQ queries.
Each query contains two integers LL and RR
For each query print the sum of integers in array from index LL to RR

Input:
    First line will contain TT, number of testcases. Then the testcases follow.
    TT blocks of line follows-
    First line of each block contains an integer NN (number of array elements).
    Next line contains NN integers (array element).
    Next line contains an integer QQ (number of queries)
    Next Q lines contains two integers LL and RR.

Output:
Print required answer for each query.
