You are given an array of N elements. All elements of the array are in range 1 to N-2. All elements occur once except two numbers, which occur twice. Your task is to find the two repeating numbers.

Input Format
First line of input contains T - number of test cases. Its followed by 2T lines, the first line contains N - the size of the array and second line contains the elements of the array.

Constraints
30 points
1 <= T <= 100
4 <= N <= 103
70 points
1 <= T <= 100
4 <= N <= 106

Output Format
Print the 2 repeated numbers in sorted manner, for each test case, separated by new line.
