Given a 2D square matrix, print the matrix in a spiral order. Refer examples for more details. From interviews point of view, after you scan the matrix in a 2D array, try to print the matrix in a spiral order without using any extra space.

Input Format
First line of input contains T - number of test cases. First line of each test case contains N - size of the matrix [NxN]. Its followed by N lines each containing N integers - elements of the matrix.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 100
-100 <= ar[i][j] <= 100

Output Format
For each test case, print the matrix in a spiral order, separated by newline.
