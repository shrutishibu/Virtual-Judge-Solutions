Given two matrices A and B each of size N x M, print sum of the matrices (A + B)..
Note: Try solving it by declaring only a single matrix.

Input Format
First line of input contains N, M - size of the matrices. Its followed by 2*N lines, each containing M integers - elements of the matrices. First N lines for matrix A and the next N lines for matrix B.

Constraints
1 <= N, M <= 100
-109 <= ar[i] <= 109

Output Format
Print sum of the 2 given matrices (A + B).
