Given 2 matrices, find the product.

Input Format
First line of input contains T - number of test cases. First line of each test case contains N1, M1 - size of the 1st matrix. Its followed by N1 lines each containing M1 intergers - elements of the 1st matrix. The next line contains N2, M2 - size of the 2nd matrix. Its followed by N2 lines each containing M2 intergers - elements of the 2nd matrix. Note that M1 = N2.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N1,M1,N2,M2 <= 50
-100 <= mat[i][j] <= 100

Output Format
For each test case, print the resultant product matrix, separated by newline.
