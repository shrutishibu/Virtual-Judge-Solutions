Given a 2D square matrix, rotate the matrix by 90 degrees in clockwise manner.
Note: Try to solve it by first scanning the matrix, then do an in-place rotation and then print the rotated matrix.

Input Format
First line of input contains T - number of test cases. First line of each test case contains N - size of the matrix [NxN]. Its followed by N lines each containing N integers - elements of the matrix.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 100
-100 <= ar[i][j] <= 100

Output Format
For each test case, print the rotated matrix, separated by newline.
