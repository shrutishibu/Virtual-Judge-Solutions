Given a 2D matrix of size NxN, print the sum of the elements of all its diagonals.

Input Format
First line of input contains T - number of test cases. First line of each test case contains N - size of the matrix. Each of the next N lines contains N integers - the elements of the matrix.

Constraints
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 100
-100 <= ar[i][j] <= 100

Output Format
For each test case, print the sum of the elements of all the diagonals, separated by newline. Refer samples for more clarity.
